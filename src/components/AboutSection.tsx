              <p>
                I am a Mobile Developer and UI/UX Designer with a strong background in 
                cross-platform and native mobile application development. Skilled in 
                Kotlin, Dart (Flutter), and Swift, I am capable of building high-quality 
                applications for both Android and iOS platforms.
              </p>
              <p>
                My expertise covers the entire development lifecycleâ€” from wireframing and 
                interface design to coding, testing, and publishing. I have been actively 
                involved in the deployment process of multiple mobile applications to both 
                the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
              </p>
              <p>
                My work emphasizes clean architecture, responsive and modern UI/UX, and 
                performance optimization, ensuring each app meets platform guidelines and 
                delivers a seamless user experience.
